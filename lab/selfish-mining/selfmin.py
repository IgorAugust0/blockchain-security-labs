"""
This code implements a permutation test to check if the sequence of consecutive mining by the most powerful miner (MP) is significantly longer than expected by chance, given the computational power of the MP.

The permutation test is a way to test if the observation made in the data could have happened by chance. In this case, we are analyzing the longest sequence of consecutive mining by the MP in November. To determine if this sequence is significant, we generate 1000 permutations of the November data, keeping the computational power of the MP constant, and count the longest sequence of consecutive mining by the MP in each permutation. This gives us a distribution of the longest sequences we would expect to see by chance.

We compare the observed longest sequence with this distribution. If the observed sequence is longer than most of the sequences in the permutation distribution, this suggests that consecutive mining by the MP is unlikely to have occurred by chance and may be the result of selfish mining.

The calculated p-value is the proportion of permutations in which the longest sequence is equal to or greater than the observed sequence. If the p-value is small (usually less than 0.05), this indicates that the observed sequence is significantly longer than expected by chance, suggesting selfish mining.

Random permutation is used to generate the mining sequences for comparison. The function np.random.permutation creates a new random order of the mining data for each permutation. This creates a distribution of "alternative scenarios" that represent what could have happened if mining were a purely random process, without selfish mining. By comparing the real mining sequence with these alternative scenarios, we can determine if the real sequence is significantly different from what is expected by chance.
